    "changelog": "### Added\n\n* New Prefab List menu item and playmode tools button to quickly list all ghost prefabs in your project or scene hierarchy.\n* Internal changes to support GameObject ghosts. More to come later. See Discussions post talking more about this work in progress.\n* [Potential Breaking Change] Moving server side's ghost spawn writes from BeginFrame ECB to new PresentationGroup ECB.\n* [Potential Breaking Change] GhostAuthoringComponent's content has been moved to a base class.\n* Netcode profiler received new tooltips and warning icons. These will show if compression efficiency is low or the snapshot size is approaching max message size.\n* Static ghosts now aggressively attempt to avoid looking up snapshot data (via `SnapshotData.GetDataAtTick`) inside the `GhostUpdateSystem.UpdateJob`, and the job itself early outs if there are no ghosts needing to restore, leading to a ~90% reduction in job timings. Profiler markers have also been added to this job, denoting which ghost types (and API calls) are taking the time.\n* Users can now migrate non ghost data using the `IncludeInMigration` component and the associated `NonGhostMigrationComponents` buffer.\n* Non-Ghost Components marked for migration on a Ghost Entity will now be automatically migrated to the correct Ghost.\n\n### Changed\n\n* Corrected ghost-types-templates docs regarding the packed vs unpacked format of `bool`, `byte`, `sbyte`, `float`, and `double`.\n* Improved the `bool` serialization template, improving packed and unpacked costs (~4 bits to 1 bit, and 32 bits to 8 bits, respectively).\n\n### Fixed\n\n* An issue with static optimized ghosts, where incorrect logic in the `GhostUpdateSystem` caused them to not have their `CopyFromSnapshot` called even once in rare cases, which led to `[GhostFields]` like `StaticAsteroid.SpawnTick` (which need additional processing via the `CopyFromSnapshot` code-gen) to be incorrect on the client.\n* `NetworkEndpoint` serialization inside GhostField's, which were mistakenly using `SerializeNetworkEndpointUnpacked` in a packed case.\n* Missing average per entity column for per ghost type overhead sections in the profiler."

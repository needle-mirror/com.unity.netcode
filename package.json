    "changelog": "### Added\n\n* Experimental host migration feature added, enabled with the ENABLE_HOST_MIGRATION define but otherwise hidden.\n* With ENABLE_HOST_MIGRATION defined, when a client reconnects to a server after disconnecting the connection entity on both sides will receive a `NetworkStreamIsReconnected` component. An internal unique ID is added to connections to track this behaviour.\n\n### Changed\n\n* IsReconnected split into NetworkStreamIsReconnected for reconnected connections and IsMigrated for re-spawned ghosts (Host Migration).\n\n### Fixed\n\n* An issue with Mutiplayer PlayModeTool window, throwing exceptions when docked after a domain reload. The issue was due to because of an access to `EditorPrefs` and `Application.productName` while restoring the window state.\n* Issue where, during host migration, ghosts could be migrated with a 0 id and type. Causing various issues when instantiated on the new host.\n* Crash which could happen after host migrations when the server is deploying the host migration data.\n* Issue with prespawn prefab entity list initialization after a host migration, the ordering of the prespawn ghosts could be shifted by one because of the internal `PrespawnSceneList` entity prefab creation. This would result in *invalid ghost type X (expected X+1)* off by one style errors."

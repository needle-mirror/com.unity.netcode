    "changelog": "### Added\n\n* Optional UUID5GhostType property to the GhostCreation.Config struct, which allows you to provide your own unique UUID5 identifier when creating a ghost prefab at runtime, instead of relying on the auto-generated one (which uses the SHA1 of the ghost name).\n* NetworkStreamDriver.ResetDriverStore to properly reset the NetworkDriverStore\n\n### Changed\n\n* All Simulate component enable states are reset to using a job instead of doing that synchronously on the main thread. Reason for the change is the fact this was inducing a big stall at the end of the Prediction loop. However, the benefits is only visible when there are a large number of jobified workload.\n* Corrected incorrect/missing CHANGELOG entries across many previous versions.\n* Updated Burst dependency to version 1.8.16\n* Unified Multiplayer Project settings.\n* Moved menu items to a collective place to improve workflows. This removes the Multiplayer menu and integrates into common places Window, Assets/Create, right-click menus, etc.\n* The dependency on Unity Transport has been updated to version 2.2.1\n* Re-exposed `TryFindAutoConnectEndPoint` and `HasDefaultAddressAndPortSet`, with small documentation updates.\n* ConcurrentDriverStore and NetworkDriverStore.Concurrent are now public and you can use the NetworkDriverStore.Concurrent in your jobs to send/receive data."

    "changelog": "### Added\n\n* A warning will now appear if you have a query involving `Simulate` while ignoring enabled state with `EntityQueryOptions.IgnoreComponentEnabledState` in the prediction loop.\n\n### Changed\n\n* Removed `ENABLE_HOST_MIGRATION` define which hid the host migration feature, it's now enabled by default. This also enables by default the `NetworkStreamIsReconnected` component which works without host migration.\n* Refactor host migration API\n  * Removed `MigrateDataToNewServerWorld`/`ConfigureClientAndConnect` helper functions. They'll be in the docs and sample instead.\n  * Renamed `HostMigrationUtility`->`HostMigrationData` and in that class renamed `Get/SetHostMigrationData` to `Get/Set` (class only contains data methods) with parameters reflecting directionality of data buffer and world. Removed `TryGetHostMigrationData`, use `Get` instead (native list version).\n  * Removed `DataStorageMethod` as it no only has one enum value.\n* The ghost component serialization method in the host migration feature changed to a much better performing one.\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Issue where `PreparePredictedData` was not being called on `GhostPlayableBehaviour`, breaking `GhostAnimationController` functionality.\n* Issue where `NetCodeConfig.EnableClientServerBootstrap` was not visible within the `NetCodeConfig`.\n* Issue when running a webgl player where you could not connect or receive connections from non-webgl platform players."

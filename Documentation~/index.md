# Unity Netcode for Entities
The Netcode for Entities package provides a dedicated server model with client prediction that you can use to create multiplayer games. This documentation covers the main features of the Netcode package.

## Preview package
This package is available as a preview, so it is not ready for production use. The features and documentation in this package might change before it is verified for release.

### Development status
The Netcode for Entities developers are prototyping the package in a simple multi-directional shooter game, similar to Asteroids, as well as another set of samples, publicly available [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/EntityComponentSystemSamples/tree/master/NetcodeSamples), which are used for both showcasing the package features and testing the package internally.

The main focus of the Netcode development team has been to figure out a good architecture to synchronize entities when using ECS. As such, there has not yet been much exploration into how to make it easy to add new types of replicated entities or integrate it with the gameplay logic. The development team will focus on these areas going forward, and are areas where they want feedback. To give feedback on this package, post on the [Unity DOTS Netcode Forum](https://forum.unity.com/forums/dots-netcode.425/).

## Installation

To install this package, follow the [installation](installation.md) instructions.

## Requirements

Netcode for Entities requires you to have Unity version __2022.2.0f1__ or higher.

This package uses Unityâ€™s [Entity Component System (ECS)](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@latest) as a foundation. As such, you must know how to use ECS to use this package.

## Known issues

* Making IL2CPP build with code stripping set low or higher crashes the player (missing constructors). Code stripping must be always set to none/minimal.
* When connecting to a server build with the editor as a client (like from frontend menu), make sure the auto-connect ip/port fields in the playmode tools are empty, if not it will get confused and create two connections to the server.
* In some rare cases, found so far only on Mac M1, a StackOverflow exception may be thrown inside the generated XXXGhostComponentSerializer.GetState method. 
Usually the problem start occurring with component sizes around 4K+. </br>
To help nailing down when this is happening, you can uncomment the following lines inside the Editor/Templates/GhostComponentSerializer.cs template (remember to recompile the source generator after that) or drag the offending 
generated class inside the assembly it pertain and modify it there.
```csharp
//ADD THIS LINE TO DEBUG IF A BIG COMPONENT MAY BE CAUSING A STACK OVERFLOW INSIDE THE GetState
// const int maxSizeToAvoidStackOverflow = 4_500;
// if (s_State.ComponentSize > maxSizeToAvoidStackOverflow)
// {
//     UnityEngine.Debug.LogWarning($"The type '{s_State.ComponentType}' is very large ({s_State.ComponentSize} bytes)! There is a risk of StackOverflowExceptions in the Serializers at roughly {maxSizeToAvoidStackOverflow} bytes! Remove large fields.");
// }
```

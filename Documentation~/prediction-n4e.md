# Managing latency with prediction

You can use client-side prediction to mitigate the effects of latency on gameplay for your users. For an overview, refer to the [client prediction page](intro-to-prediction.md).

This current page covers how to implement client prediction in your game.

There are also some [client prediction edge cases](prediction-details.md) you should be aware of.

## Prediction in Netcode for Entities

Prediction only runs for entities that have the [`PredictedGhost`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.netcode@latest/index.html?subfolder=/api/Unity.NetCode.PredictedGhost.html) and [`Simulate`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@latest/index.html?subfolder=/api/Unity.Entities.Simulate.html) components. Unity adds the `PredictedGhost` component to all predicted ghosts on the client, and to all ghosts on the server. On the client, the component also contains some data it needs for the prediction, such as which snapshot has been applied to the ghost.

The prediction is based on a fixed time-step loop, controlled by the [`PredictedSimulationSystemGroup`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.netcode@0latest/index.html?subfolder=/api/Unity.NetCode.PredictedSimulationSystemGroup.html),
which runs on both client and server, and that usually contains the core part of the deterministic ghosts simulation.

The primary API elements involved in prediction are:

- The `Simulate` tag, which filters ghosts to simulate.
- The `PredictedSimulationSystemGroup` system group where your predicted simulation should run. Like `FixedUpdate`, this can run multiple times per frame.
- The `IInputComponentData` interface, which sends inputs associated with ticks.
- `HasOwner`, `AutoCommandTarget`, `SupportedGhostMode`, and `DefaultGhostMode` on the `GhostAuthoringComponent`. to set whether a ghost is predicted or not.
- The `NetworkTime` singleton:
  - `NetworkTime.ServerTick` for the latest simulation tick (both client-predicted tick and server-side tick). In front of the last received snapshot tick by an amount depending on lag.
  - `NetworkTime.InterpolationTick` for the current client-side interpolation tick. Generally behind the last received snapshot tick.
  - Both of the above have a `XXFraction` field available.
  - `NetworkTime.IsPartialTick` denoting whether or not the current tick being predicted is only a fraction of a full tick, which is useful when rendering timings misalign with fixed step simulation timings.
  - `NetworkTime.IsFirstTimeFullyPredictingTick` is a common flag used in predicted systems, which guards one off operations (like the instantiation of predicted ghost spawns, and V/SFX on the client) so that they only happen once.```
  - So `IT | | Snapshot | | | | | | | | | | ST`

## Client-side `PredictedSimulationSystemGroup`

When the prediction runs, the `PredictedSimulationSystemGroup` sets the correct time for the current prediction tick in the ECS `TimeData` struct. It also sets the `ServerTick` in the [`NetworkTime`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.netcode@latest/index.html?subfolder=/api/Unity.NetCode.NetworkTime.html) singleton to the tick being predicted (among other fields/conveniences).

> [!NOTE]
> The rollback and prediction resimulation can add a substantial overhead to each frame.
> Example: For a 300ms connection, expect ~22 frames of re-simulation. In other words, physics and all other systems in the `PredictedSimulationSystemGroup` will tick ~22 times in a single frame.
> You can test this by setting a high simulated ping in the `PlayMode Tools Window`.
> See the [Optimizations](optimizations.md) page for further details.

## Simulate tag (partial snapshots)

Netcode for Entities supports partial snapshots. If your world state update can't be contained in a single packet, Netcode streams the state over multiple ticks, with each snapshot only containing a subset of your entities. Because the prediction loop runs from the oldest tick applied to any entity, and some entities might already have newer data, **you must check whether each entity needs to be simulated or not**. Since the simulation tags are enabled both client and server side, you can reuse the same code in both cases.

There are two ways to perform this check, the second one being included for legacy reasons.

### Check which entities to predict using the `Simulate` tag component (PREFERRED)

The client uses the `Simulate` tag, present on all entities in world, to specify whether a ghost entity should be predicted or not.

- At the beginning of the prediction loop, the `Simulate` tag is disabled for all `Predicted` ghosts.
- For each prediction tick, the `Simulate` tag is enabled for all the entities that should be simulated for that tick.
- At the end of the prediction loop, all predicted ghost entities' `Simulate` components are guaranteed to be enabled.

In game systems that run in the `PredictedSimulationSystemGroup` (or any of its sub-groups) you should add the following to your queries: EntitiesForEach (deprecated) and an idiomatic foreach `.WithAll&lt;Simulate&gt;>` condition. This automatically gives the job (or function) the correct set of entities you need to work on.

For example:

```c#

Entities
    .WithAll<PredictedGhost, Simulate>()
    .ForEach(ref Translation trannslation)
{                 
      ///Your update logic here
}
```

### Check which entities to predict using the `PredictedGhost.ShouldPredict` helper method (LEGACY)

This is a legacy method of performing these checks and is not recommended, although it is still supported. You can call the static method  [`PredictedGhost.ShouldPredict`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.netcode@latest/index.html?subfolder=/api/Unity.NetCode.PredictedGhost.html#Unity_NetCode_PredictedGhost_ShouldPredict_System_UInt32_) before updating an entity. In this case the method or job that updates the entity should look something like this:

```c#

var serverTick = GetSingleton<NetworkTime>().ServerTick;
Entities
    .WithAll<PredictedGhost, Simulate>()
    .ForEach(ref Translation trannslation)
{                 
      if!(PredictedGhost.ShouldPredict(serverTick))
           return;

      ///Your update logic here
}
```

If an entity didn't receive any new data from the network since the last prediction ran, and it ended with simulating a full tick (which is not always true when you use a dynamic time-step), the prediction continues from where it finished last time, rather than applying the network data.

## Server simulation

On the server, the prediction loop always runs exactly once, and doesn't update the `TimeData` struct (because it's already correct). The simulation on the server is not a predicted one, but the official authoritative version of the game simulation. The `ServerTick` in the `NetworkTime` singleton also has the correct value, so the same code can run on both the client and server.

Thus, the `PredictedGhost.ShouldPredict` always returns true when called on the server, and the `Simulate` component is also always enabled.

> [!NOTE]
> For predicted gameplay systems, you can write the code*once, and it will work on both client and server (without needing to make a distinction about where it's running).

## Remote player prediction

### Remote player prediction with `IInputComponentData`

If inputs are configured to be serialized to other players (refer to [GhostSnapshots](ghost-snapshots.md#icommanddata-and-iinputcomponentdata-serialization)), then it's possible to use client-side prediction for the remote players using the remote player's inputs, the same way you would predict the local player.

When a new snapshot is received by the client, the `PredictedSimulationSystemGroup` runs from the oldest tick applied to any entity, to the tick the prediction is targeting. What needs to be predicted can vary by entity, and you must always check if the entity needs to update/apply the input for a specific tick by only processing entities with the `Simulate` component.

Your input data for the current simulated tick will be updated automatically by Netcode for you.

```c#
    protected override void OnUpdate()
    {
        Entities
            .WithAll<PredictedGhost, Simulate>()
            .ForEach((Entity entity, ref Translation translation, in MyInput input) =>
        {                 
              ///Your update logic here
        }).Run();
    }   
```

### (Legacy) commands

If using the legacy commands, you need to check or retrieve the input buffer yourself.

```c#
    protected override void OnUpdate()
    {
        var tick = GetSingleton<NetworkTime>().ServerTick;
        Entities
            .WithAll<Simulate>()
            .ForEach((Entity entity, ref Translation translation, in DynamicBuffer<MyInput> inputBuffer) =>
            {
                if (!inputBuffer.GetDataAtTick(tick, out var input))
                    return;

                //your move logic
            }).Run();
    }
```

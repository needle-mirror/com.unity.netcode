# Host migration requirements

Understand the requirements for using host migration in a project and which platforms are supported.

After ensuring your project meets these requirements, you can move on to [setting up host migration systems in your project](host-migration-systems.md).

## Requirements

Before you can use host migration in a project, you need the following:

- An active Unity account with a valid license.
- The Unity Hub.
- A supported version of the Unity 6 Editor.
- Access to the Unity Cloud Dashboard.

## Unity project setup

You can start a new Unity project, or use the [Asteroids sample](../host-migration-sample.md) to quickly get started testing host migration in Netcode for Entities. When you create a new project, connect the project to Unity Cloud by selecting the **Connect to Unity Cloud** checkbox.

## Packages

- Netcode for Entities (com.unity.netcode): 1.5.0-exp.100
- Multiplayer Services SDK (com.unity.services.multiplayer): 1.2.0-exp.2

## Services and costs

Host migration coordination and state transfer is a feature provided by the [Unity Lobby](https://docs.unity.com/ugs/en-us/manual/lobby/manual/unity-lobby-service) service. The feature is included at no additional charge. Upload and download bandwidth for host migration data is not billable and does not count towards the free tier allowance or paid tier.

The [Unity Relay](https://docs.unity.com/ugs/en-us/manual/relay/manual/introduction) service works in conjunction with the Lobby service and guarantees reliable connectivity by relaying the messages between all parties in a game session. Relay pricing is based on connection time and egress bandwidth. The Free tier allows up to 50 average monthly CCUs and 3GiB of bandwidth per concurrent user.

Visit the [Unity Gaming Services Pricing page](https://unity.com/products/gaming-services/pricing) for details.
